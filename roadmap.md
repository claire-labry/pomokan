# roadmap

- [x] Research which UI/UX frameworks to use [leaning towards react]
- [x] Come up with a snazzy title (Pomokan - an inclusive way to organizing your daily tasks)
- [x] Pick three primary colors (productivity colors: restful green (#96AB36), calming blue(#96CCB9), & mellow yellow(#FFE251))
- [x] Pick a logo and a cutesy mascot that encourages people (think Clippy in Office Assistant) (mascot shall come much later in future updates)
- [x] problem solved: for people who prefer to use a timer that has flash instead of sound & can categorize their kanban tasks around a pomodoro approach. (deaf folks, folks who prefer to not have sound)
- [x] languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express.js, maybe: ember.js (will need research a bit more on this and read documentation if this will be benefical https://emberjs.com/)
